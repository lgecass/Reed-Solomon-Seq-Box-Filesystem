# Reed-Solomon-Seq-Box-Filesystem
A data preservation and recovery focused filesystem enhanced with Reed-Solomon Data error correction and Seq-Box data block recognition <br/>
Files after being placed into the mounted Folder are copied and encoded. <br/>
Everytime you read it should compare the Hashes between these 2 files and repair the file if needed. <br/>
The .sbx File represents the original file and is the only file you need to replace your original data. <br/>
The .sbx file does not depend on the original file. <br/>

## Installation - Should work on Ubuntu/Debian
### Fast Installation with Script
`git clone https://github.com/lgecass/Reed-Solomon-Seq-Box-Filesystem.git`<br/>
`cd Reed-Solomon-Seq-Box-Filesystem`<br/>
`chmod +x install.sh`<br/>
`./install.sh`<br/>
### Full Installation Steps
`git clone https://github.com/lgecass/Reed-Solomon-Seq-Box-Filesystem.git`<br/>
`cd Reed-Solomon-Seq-Box-Filesystem`<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse.git`<br/>
`cd libfuse`<br/>
`mkdir build; cd build`<br/>
`meson setup ..`<br/>
`ninja`<br/>
`sudo ninja install`<br/>
`pip install --upgrade reedsolo --no-binary "reedsolo" --no-cache --config-setting="--build-option=--cythonize" --use-pep517 --isolated --pre --verbose`<br/>



## Usage
### Mount filesystem
`python ./RS_SeqBox/Sbx_Rsc_filesystem.py working_directory shield_directory`
<br/>
working_directory keeps files while filesystem is mounted. 
<br/>
shield_directory keeps files permanently even after the filesystem is unmounted.
### Unmount filesystem
`umount -l destinationmount`

## Recover files from corrupted data drive
### Make an image file out of the Partition where files cannot be recognized
`sudo dd if=/dev/<data_drive_partition> of=image.ima bs=1M status=progress`
### Scan the image for Files
`python ./RS_SeqBox/sbxscan.py image.ima` <- This creates a .db3 file
### Preview all the files that had been recognized by scanning
`python ./RS_SeqBox/sbxreco.py sbxscan.db3 -i`
### Recover all files
`python ./RS_SeqBox/sbxreco.py sbxscan.db3 --all`
### Decode files into their normal fileformat
`python ./RS_SeqBox/sbxdec.py <file to decode>`
